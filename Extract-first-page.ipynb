      "subjective information in source materials. The main challenge encountered in machine learning method-based sentiment classification\n",
      "is the abundant amount of data available. This amount makes it difficult to train the learning algorithms in a feasible time and degrades\n",
      "the classification accuracy of the built model. Hence, feature selection becomes an essential task in developing robust and efficient clas-\n",
      "sification models whilst reducing the training time. In text mining applications, individual filter-based feature selection methods have\n",
      "been widely utilized owing to their simplicity and relatively high performance. This paper presents an ensemble approach for feature\n",
      "selection, which aggregates the several individual feature lists obtained by the different feature selection methods so that a more robust\n",
      "and efficient feature subset can be obtained. In order to aggregate the individual feature lists, a genetic algorithm has been utilized.\n",

      "nearly trivial if it was grounded in an ontological structure that is, “isomorphic to the \n",

      "at this ontological structure that implicitly underlies all that we say in everyday \n",
